# Financial Engineering
 This is an ongoing project creating a set of comprehensive programs, written in C++, to demonstrate the implementation of a variety of techniques in financial engineering such as options pricing.

The auxillary functionality that this project needs are in the files:
	stats.cpp/.h
	linearInterpolation.cpp/.h
	histogram.cpp/.h
	date.cpp/.h
These classes are tested with a range of test cases and edge cases in the files:
	test_stats.cpp/.h
	test_linearInterpolation.cpp/.h
	test_histogram.cpp/.h
	test_date.cpp/.h
